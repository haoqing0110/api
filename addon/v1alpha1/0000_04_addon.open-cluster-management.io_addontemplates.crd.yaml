During the addon registration process, a csr will be created for each RegistrationSpec on the hub cluster. The CSR can be approved automatically(Auto) or manually(None), After the csr is approved on the hub cluster, the klusterlet agent will create a secret in the installNamespace for the addon agent. If the RegistrationType type is KubeClient, the secret name will be "{addon name}-hub-kubeconfig" whose content includes key/cert and kubeconfig. Otherwise, If the RegistrationType type is CustomSigner the secret name will be "{addon name}-{signer name}-client-cert" whose content includes key/cert.
